<h1>App Overview</h1>

This console app creates an empty multi-value string dictionary (MVD) and allows the user to interact with it using various commands.

<h3><b>Note: The MVD is not persistent and is lost when the application quits or is closed.</b></h3>

<h1>Testing</h1>

Unit tests have been written for the app's primary functions corresponding to valid commands. 
For the helper functions controlling the flow through the app, integration testing is likely a better solution but has yet to be scoped for this project.

<h1>Build</h1>

Python 3.10

<h1>Run</h1>
python3 spreetail_worksample_run.py

<h3><b>Note: This app should work in any OS compatible with Python 3.10, but it has only been tested in Windows 10.</b></h3>
